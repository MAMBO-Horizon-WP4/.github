# MAMBO (Modern Approaches to the Monitoring of Biodiversity)

[MAMBO](https://www.mambo-project.eu/)’s work programme aims to provide knowledge, tools and infrastructure for monitoring wildlife and their habitats more comprehensively.

One objective is to develop consistent and standardised habitat condition metrics using state of the art drone imagery or airborne LiDAR and integrating the data into a deep learning framework. 

The lead organisation for this objective is [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/)

MAMBO receives funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under grant agreement No.101060639.
